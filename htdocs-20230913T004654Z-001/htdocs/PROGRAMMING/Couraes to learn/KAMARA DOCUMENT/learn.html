If you’ve got a passion for all things B2B and online business-related, webinar 
affiliate programs can be a terrific source of income. While we can all agree 
coronavirus is definitely a bad thing, it’s given the webinar industry a huge
shot in the arm. With in-person meetings and conferences hit hard by the pandemic, 
the use of webinars rose by an astonishing 162% year on year in 2020, according to 
webinar platform ON24, while attendance almost quadrupled to 60 million. It’s no 
surprise that 85% of marketers who use webinars as a marketing tool say
that webinars are a key part of their marketing efforts. That’s reflected in 
the growing value of the global webinar and webcast market, which is expected 
to be worth $800 million by 2023. Fancy a piece of the action? Want to promote
 your favorite webinar creation tools and earn commissions for your efforts?

                    Hi, I’m Kamara, a freelance writer specializing in all things digital marketing. I 
                    worked for a bunch of marketing agencies in the UK, before leaving when I realized 
                    I could basically do this job from anywhere. Beyond marketing, I love travel, my cat,
                     and wearing a vest under an open shirt.
